{% highlight yaml %}
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    konghq.com/methods: "GET"
    konghq.com/protocols: "http"
spec:
  ingressClassName: kong
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
          # Whole path case insensitive
          - path: /(?i)api/case-insensitive/
          pathType: Prefix
          backend:
              service:
              name: my-api
              port: 
                  number: 80
          # Only part of the path is case insensitive
          - path: /api/(?i)case-insensitive(?-i)/
          pathType: Prefix
          backend:
              service:
